In this short guide I will explain how to delete all photos from your iPhone.
For this method of clearing your iPhone you don't need iTunes or any other software, just the default Preview app that is available on every Mac will suffice.

1. Open the Preview app on your Mac
2. Click the **File** menu item and now select the **Import from [iPhone name]**
3. Press `CMD + A` to select all photos
4. Click the delete symbol on the bottom of the window. (see screenshot below)
