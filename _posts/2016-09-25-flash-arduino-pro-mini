pin connections

UNO ---> Pro Mini (3.3v and 5v)
5v > VCC (also for the 3.3v version)
GND > GND
10 > RST
11 > 11
12 > 12
13 > 13

Put Arduino as ISP sketch on UNO
Select board type pro mini
Select USB port
And hit burn bootloader

* 3.3v pro mini should also be powered with 5v during flashing the bootloader
* don't power through raw pin or it will not work
* you see some people using a capacitor for the RST pin but that is not needed when using pin 10 (only needed when using RST pin of ISCP header? because it stays low)
