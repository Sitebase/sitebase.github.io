Do you ever hit that caps lock button by mistake too? This annoyed me so much that I decided to find a solution for this.


After a quick Google search I found a simple solution for this in OSX. You can disable it if you go to `System Preferences` > `Keyboard` > `Modify Keys...`. Now you can set `caps lock` to `No Action`.
