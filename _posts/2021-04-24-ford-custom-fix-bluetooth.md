After connecting a few different Bluetooth devices to my Ford Transit custom SYNC system, I was suddenly unable to connect anymore using my regular phone.
It turns out there is a straightforward fix for this problem. You have to reset the SYNC system which can be done by following the steps below:

Find the [fuse](https://tidd.ly/34ZZ8GY) `F37` which should be in the fuse box at the drivers side.

<br />
You can confirm the fuse position by searching in the PDF version of the manual for `SYNC module`.


F37 GPS/sync fuse
* turn the ignition off
* remove key
* remove fuse
* turn ignition on
* go to sync settitng menu (try to connect to your phone to get error `SYNC not available`)
* turn everything off
* remove key
* insert fuse
* turn ignition on

And after these steps, you'll be ready to connect again.
It can take a minute before sync is booted.
