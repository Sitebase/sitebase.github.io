# Sitebase Homepage
This repository contains the source for my [www.sitebase.be website](https://www.sitebase.be).

## Develop
To work on the website you run following command:

>jekyll serve --watch

## Setup
My current setup is using GitHub pages as hosting and in front of this I use [CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com) as an extra caching and optimization layer.
